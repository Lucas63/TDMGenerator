# TDMGenerator
Program which generating solves for Decision making theor calculus and graphical work. 
Calculus and graphical work structure :
1. Build graph of ratio
<p>
2.1. Analyze given ratio
<p>
2.2. Decide which type of ratio is

3.1.1.Build symmetric part of ration(build adjacency matrix)
<p>
3.1.2.Build graph of it
<p>
3.1.3.Analyze this ratio

3.2.1.Build asymmetric part of ration(build adjacency matrix)
<p>
3.2.2.Build graph of it
3.2.3.Analyze this ratio

3.3.1.Build non comparable relation on given ratio (build adjacency matrix)
<p>
3.3.2.Build graph of it
3.3.3.Analyze this ration
